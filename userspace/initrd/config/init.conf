## MOS init configurations
##
## CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX:
##
## Each line is a key-value pair, separated by an equals sign,
## spaces before and after the equals sign are ignored.
## The line ends with a newline '\n' character.
##
## Comments start with a hash '#' character and end with a newline '\n' character.
## Comments can be placed anywhere in the file, except inside a key-value pair.
##
## If a key is specified multiple times, it's considered an array, however the
## behavior depends on the key, for example, an 'arg' key is supposed to be an
## array but a 'path' key is not.

## Device Manager configuration
## path, and args to the device manager executable
device_manager.path = /initrd/programs/device-manager
## device_manager.args =

## Drivers configuration
## The drivers are loaded in the order they are specified in the file.
## The drivers listed below are always loaded regardless of the platform support.
driver = /drivers/x86_console_driver

## Filesystems configuration
##
## The filesystems are mounted in the order they are specified in the file.
##
## Format:
##     mount = <Device> <MountPoint> <Filesystem> <Options>
##
## Device:     the device to mount, can be a device node or a path to a file, or 'none' for a virtual filesystem
## MountPoint: the mount point, the mount point should be either an:
##             - absolute path, e.g. /tmp, or
##             - relative path, e.g. tmp, relative to the root directory
## Filesystem: the filesystem type, can be a filesystem name
## Options:    the mount options, this is filesystem specific
##
## Note that the initrd is always mounted as the root filesystem, and
## it's always read-only.
