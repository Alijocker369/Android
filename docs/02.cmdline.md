# 2. Kernel cmdline Reference

A `cmdline` is a string that's passed to the kernel by the bootloader. It can be used to configure the kernel at runtime.

The following options are available for the kernel, they will be parsed and applied by the kernel at boot time.

Options that are not listed below will be ignored by the kernel, and then passed as arguments to the init program.

## General Options

- `init=`: Path to the init program, defaults to `/programs/init`.
- `printk_console=`: The name of the console to use for kernel messages,
  prefix-based search is used if the name is not an exact match.
  - `serial_com1` (default): Use COM1 for kernel messages.
- `poweroff_on_panic`: Power off the machine when the kernel panics, instead of halting.
- `quiet`: Disable kernel messages once the kernel has booted, except for kernel panics where this option is ignored.

## Unit Tests Options

These options are only useful if you are running MOS tests, (i.e. `BUILD_TESTING` is set to `ON` when building the kernel).

- `mos_tests`: Run MOS tests.
- `mos_tests_skip_prefix`: Skip tests with the given prefix.
- `mos_tests_halt_on_success`: Halt the kernel after all tests have passed, instead of continuing to boot.
